# The Complicator

Code Authors: Grayson Boyer, Everett Shock
Data Compilers: GEOPIG Lab

This is an unreleased prototype Python package for estimating standard state thermodynamic properties and Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) equation of state parameters for aqueous inorganic complexes with monovalent ligands using published methods from [Shock and Koretsky 1995](https://doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(95)00058-8).

**It does not yet include any of the novel estimation methods proposed in our recently submitted NSF proposal for [GEO-CM](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/novel-approaches-critical-minerals-research).**
